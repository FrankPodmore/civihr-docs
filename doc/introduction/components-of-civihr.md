Components of CiviHR
==========

Components give you more tools to interact with your contacts. You can
use as many or as few of these as you need and then can be turned on and
off as necessary. Turning off, or disabling modules that you aren't
using removes them from the user interface, e.g. from the menu system,
the advanced search page and so on. This simplifies the appearance of
CiviCRM for your users. You can also set permissions so that only
certain users can see certain components, for example so that only
fundraisers can see financial information. 

Turning off a component will not remove any data from CiviCRM - just
hide it. When you turn it on again, the data will re-appear.

Each component is explained in detail in its own section so only a brief
description is given here.

**1. Staff Profile**Â  
---------------

Store all information about your staff member including their contact details, job contracts (with effective dates for new revisions and changes), job roles, medical information, eligibility to work & other essential records. CiviHR is flexible, allowing you to add and remove fields as required. All changes are tracked and history recorded for easy future reference.

**2. Tasks and Reminders**
-------------

CiviHR helps you manage onboarding and exiting staff members using our tasks and assignments module. Assign internal tasks and staff can review it's due date, notes, and attachments on their portal. You can also send automated emails and schedule tasks for the new joiners to receive when they start. 

**3. Leave and Absence**
-------------

The comprehensive leave and absence module helps you to calculate and pro rata leave entitlements for flexible workers, full time and part time staff. Staff request leave from their Self Service Portal, and can attach any documents or add comments for their manager. Managers can view calendars and reports of all staff they are leave approvers for.   

**4. Recruitment (ATS)**
-------------

The comprehensive leave and absence module helps you to calculate and pro rata leave entitlements for flexible workers, full time and part time staff. Staff request leave from their Self Service Portal, and can attach any documents or add comments for their manager. Managers can view calendars and reports of all staff they are leave approvers for.
